<P>
<H1><A NAME="m4 libraries">M4 LIBRARIES</A></H1>
<P>Docs on the m4 library structure and how to add new ones</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="rules">RULES</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="naming">NAMING</A></H2>
<P>Library filename should be in all lowercase with a .m4 extension</P>
<P>Macronames should be all uppercase with the appropriate prefix. See <A HREF="#namespace">NAMESPACE</A>.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="diverting">DIVERTING</A></H2>
<P>Only divert in the container, or main files. That will save some lines of output. And
in almost all cases loading a library is done inside of it's own divert. Divert is an
on and off switch, not a stack, so undiverting inside a library will turn off divert 
for the main script. Be aware of this, and don't divert in libraries if possible.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="quotes">QUOTES</A></H2>
<P>Only use ``['' and ``]'' quotes in your libraries. The 1 exception to this is derivations of this
pattern. (I.e. ``[['',``]]'' &amp; ``[[['',``]]]'' etc ...)</P>
<P>This is because ``[['' resolves to ``'' the same as ``['' resolves to ``'' and under the context of ``['',``]'', 
``[['',``]]'' still resolves to ``'' (it is just double quoted). This will allow for most file types, 
although recursive macro expansion in this scenario hasn't been tested completely. Jim's guess is
that there are cases where the quotes will mess up some base implementations.</P>
<P>Simple expansions (only 1x expanded) will work just fine in this scenario.</P>
<P>Also, calling <CODE>m4_changequote</CODE> to change to the current chars will throw an m4 error, so make sure
that you call something obscure like <CODE>m4_changequote([++,++])</CODE> to clear the quotes before setting 
the quotes. Quotes are the most confusing part of the m4 binary!</P>
<PRE>
 For example:
    File1.m4 contains:
         m4_divert(-1)
         m4_changequote([,])
         m4_include(file2.m4)
         m4_divert</PRE>
<PRE>
    File2.m4 contains:
         m4_divert(-1)
         m4_changequote([,])
         m4_define([],[])
         m4_divert</PRE>
<P>This scenario will fail! with an M4:EOF message. The reason is that the 2nd changequote is trying
to set the quotes to what they already are. This is the case when libraries start loading each other
or scripts load libraries, and their own functions... In this case, you must do:</P>
<PRE>
    File2.m4 contains:
         m4_divert(-1)
         m4_changequote([++,++])m4_dnl or some other set of chars!
         m4_changequote([,])
         m4_define([],[])
         m4_divert</PRE>
<P>This ``clears'' the quote setting before setting quotes. <STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> If you use the ``tick'' and ``singlequote'' as your
quote delimiters, you run into the same problem if the library is the first to load, since that is what the default characters are. Make sure that these
quotes are unique, and likely never used to actually deliminate a library.</P>
<P>M4:EOF error messages are standard when the quoting scheme is messed up. If you get one of these
9 times out of 10 it is because there is a missing quote on a <CODE>m4_define</CODE> somewhere, or your
<CODE>m4_ifelse</CODE> or <CODE>m4_ifdef</CODE> <EM>or a similar function</EM> is quoted improperly. These are <STRONG>nasty</STRONG> to
find, so BE CAREFUL!</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="namespace">NAMESPACE</A></H2>
<P>Each file needs to define it's own namespace. This is so that there aren't collisions across
libaries creating *really* hard to track bugs. The namespace should be the same as the filename
in uppercase. So if you write the ``somethingorother.m4'' library, all macros in your library
should be implemented as: ``SOMETHINGOROTHER_MACRO''. Abbreviations are allowed, but need to
be documented.</P>
<P>base.m4 is *special*</P>
<P>base is an extension of ``m4_'' therefore, all commands in this file should define m4_ as the
prefix. This ISN'T done automatically (like it used to be). In general, when deciding if something
is an extension to the base, you should ask yourself:
  * Is it applicable to all libraries - is it infact ``extending'' the m4 base language?
  * does this macro contain a bunch of other base m4 calls, and not much else?</P>
<P>Yes to either of these (and likely both), and it is a good idea to put it in this file.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="dependency">DEPENDENCY</A></H2>
<P>There are macro dependencies and library dependencies. This functionality exists so that you
can define the dependencies directly in the library files, and then just include a single
macro or library in the script that implements the library/macro and have all the correct
functionality. See the note below for additional information on this!</P>
<P>Use: <CODE>m4_dep([macro name])</CODE> for macro dependencies, and <CODE>m4_lib_dep([library name])</CODE> for 
library dependencies. The library name DOES NOT take the .m4 extension. 
The end result is that the dependency information is only loaded once.</P>
<P><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> The library dependency DOES NOT work. This is due to a quoting issue. The way the macro
is written currently, the m4_include is inside a quoted block. This throws off the quoting of all
the included macros, since they treated as double-quoted. (At least this is how I am interpreting
it at this time. For this reason, just use <CODE>m4_include</CODE>s to load external libraries.</P>
<P>If you want to use this functionality, you have to <CODE>m4_include(dep.m4)</CODE> before calling
it's functions.</P>
<P>BEWARE that you don't change quotes to the multiples in a library that is called. This will set
off m4 recursion, and it will take a while to die. I.e. DO NOT:</P>
<PRE>
 file1.m4
   m4_changequote([,])
   m4_lib_dep(file2)</PRE>
<PRE>
 file2.m4
   m4_changequote([[[,]]])
   ...</PRE>
<P>This WILL NOT work, and there is no workaround at this time!</P>
<P>The dep.m4 library is *special* in the sense that it defines additions to the m4 base set
of macros. Unless you are specifically augmenting or changing the dependency functionality,
there is no reason to directly edit this file.</P>
<P>There is also a <CODE>m4_req</CODE> function that is used to specify required variables. This is used to specify
variables that are <STRONG>required</STRONG> to get a function to compile. If the variables are not specified, then
the m4 compilation will crash letting you know what variable needs to be specified:</P>
<P>It is implemented in a library like this:</P>
<PRE>
 m4_define([DB_GETDBCONNECTION],[
 m4_dep([DB_GLOBALS])
 m4_dep([DB_ENDDBCONNECTION])
 m4_dep([DB_DBERROROUT])
 m4_req([username])
 m4_req([password])
 Function GetDBConnection(ServerName, DBName)
        UserName = &quot;GLOBAL_VAR([username])&quot;
        Password = &quot;GLOBAL_VAR([password])&quot;
 End Function</PRE>
<P>It is implemented in the calling script like this:</P>
<PRE>
 GLOBAL_VAR(username,jrenwick)
 GLOBAL_VAR(password,jrenwick)</PRE>
<P>On a side note, the reason this exists is to avoid 
nesting the argument calls to different macros.
After looking at this stuff for a while, and doing things like,</P>
<PRE>
 m4_define([foo],[$1 = something and macro bar returns: bar($*)])
 m4_define([bar],[shift($*)])</PRE>
<P>which is confusing enough at 1 level let alone 2 or 
three, or appending variables to loops, etc...
It became clear that it was best for macros to 
specify global variables that they depended on.</P>
<P>The difference between an <CODE>m4_req</CODE> and and 
<CODE>m4_dep</CODE> is that a req will die with errors, a dep will
continue on without complaining. Since a variable 
is just a macro, you can use either dep
or req to pull in both variables and other macros. 
This is handy when you want to override macros
depending on the language or platform that is being implemented. 
The other difference is that <CODE>m4_dep</CODE> sets a global variable: <CODE>_[MACRONAME]_loaded</CODE>
equal to ``1''. This can be used to check if a library is being implemented, 
and incorporate code specific to that library, i.e.</P>
<PRE>
 m4_define([foo],[Age Functionality ...])
 m4_define([bar],[
  m4_dep(foo)
  Main Processing ...
  m4_ifelse(_foo_loaded,1,
   [Main processing code that is specific to foo ...])
 ])</PRE>
<P>Again, this avoids nesting variables, and it allows a global way to 
tie together all the custom library functionality.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="gotcha m4 variable names">GOTCHA M4 VARIABLE NAMES</A></H2>
<P>The following variable names are all defined in the make env:</P>
<PRE>
 export SYSTEM          =       
 export platform        =       $(shell uname)
 export SHELL           =       bash
 export ECHO            =       echo
 export BSDECHO         =       $(ECHO) -n
 export ATTECHO         =       $(ECHO)
 export CPP             =       cpp
 export M4              =       m4
 export PERL            =       perl
 CC             =       gcc
 RM             =       /bin/rm</PRE>
<P>Be careful when specifying these values in scripts with 
M4_VARIABLES. If there is a space in 
a command (as is the case with $BSDECHO), you will find 
that your m4 conversions are failing.
This is because the ``-n'' shows up as a separate argument 
to m4 on the commandline.</P>
<P>In this situation, you need to use single or double quotes to enclose the char on the commandline.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="test functions">TEST FUNCTIONS</A></H2>
<P>You *should* implement a macro that tests all the macros in your library. The naming convention
for this is: <CODE>_[LIBRARYNAME]_TEST</CODE> in all uppercase.</P>
<P>When the test infrastructure is run against the library, it will be parsed with the following
syntax similar to:
<CODE>$ echo -e &quot;m4_include([LIBRARYNAME].m4)\n\n _[LIBRARYNAME]_TEST&quot; | m4 --prefix-builtins --include=/
home/jrenwick/work/ListGen/CodeGenerator/m4</CODE></P>
<P>This results in the output being written to stdout. The output can be compared (cmp) against 
the expected results.</P>
<P>See the test infrastructure docs for more information on setting up and running tests.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="structure">STRUCTURE</A></H2>
<P>Of course, any structure that you can think of can be used. :) However, the current m4 pathing information
points only to the root m4 libraries. Therefore, if you know that you are going to want to break up your
libraries into sub libraries, then follow the perl standard for library naming. That is, a file at the root
with the name, libraryname.m4 and a folder with the name, libraryname. Then inside the folder, add all your
additional libraries, and make sure to reference the correct path from your top level library. 
A sample of the top level library file may be:</P>
<PRE>
 m4_divert(-1)m4_dnl
 m4_include(dep.m4)
 # this file is a wrapper around the Windows specific libraries. You only need to
 # reference this 1 file to get all the functionality
 m4_include(Windows/VBS/dbaccess.m4)
 m4_include(Windows/VBS/scm.m4)
 m4_include(Windows/VBS/vbfilemanip.m4)
 m4_include(Windows/VBS/vbscript.m4)
 m4_include(Windows/VBS/windows.m4)
 m4_changequote(&lt;+++,+++&gt;)
 m4_changequote([,])
 m4_divert</PRE>
<P>This structure is recursive and should be used as a guideline to help structure libraries for your
projects. To date, I haven't seen a library that loads enough sub libraries and macros to put a 
significant load on m4. If performance becomes an issue, consider sub dividing the top level libs.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="overriding macros">OVERRIDING MACROS</A></H2>
<P>This is where things get interesting. Once you know what macros are available, you can change
them at compile time by calling <CODE>m4_pushdef</CODE> to alter the macro definition. Following is
a list of macros that it makes sense to do this with...</P>
<PRE>
 _ECHO : Defaults to &quot;Response.Write&quot; from the Windows.m4 library include.
         Other interesting values may be &quot;Wscript.Echo&quot;</PRE>
<PRE>
 _REQUEST(var) : Defaults to &quot;CommandLineArgs(&quot;var&quot;)&quot; from the Windows.m4 library include.
         Other interesting values may be &quot;Wscript.Arguments(&quot;var&quot;)&quot; or &quot;Request(&quot;var&quot;)&quot;</PRE>
<PRE>
 _END : Defaults to &quot;Wscript.Quit&quot; from the Windows.m4 library include.
         Other interesting values may be &quot;Response.End&quot;</PRE>
<PRE>
 _BUFFER : m4_pushdef([_BUFFER],[m4_dep(LIB_COMMANDLINEARGS)])
         Other interesting values may be &quot;Response.Buffer = False&quot;</PRE>
<PRE>
 _SCRIPT_HEADER : m4_pushdef([_SCRIPT_HEADER],[])
         Other interesting values may be &quot;&lt;%@language=vbs%&gt;&lt;%&quot;</PRE>
<PRE>
 _SCRIPT_FOOTER : m4_pushdef([_SCRIPT_FOOTER],[])
         Other interesting values may be &quot;%&gt;&quot;</PRE>
<P>The following formatting directives are also available:</P>
<PRE>
 m4_pushdef([_PARA_START],[])
 m4_pushdef([_PARA_END],[vbNewLine])
 m4_pushdef([_TABLE_START],[])
 m4_pushdef([_TABLE_END],[vbNewLine])
 m4_pushdef([_HEADERROW_START],[&quot;   &quot;])
 m4_pushdef([_HEADERROW_END],[])
 m4_pushdef([_ROW_START],[])
 m4_pushdef([_ROW_END],[vbNewLine])
 m4_pushdef([_CELL_START],[&quot;   &quot;])
 m4_pushdef([_CELL_END],[])</PRE>
<P>Formatting is defined internal to a macro with:</P>
<PRE>
 m4_define([B_APPEND],[m4_ifelse($1,,[$1],[$1 $2])])
 m4_define([F_APPEND],[m4_ifelse($1,,[$1],[$2 $1])])</PRE>
<P>I.E.:</P>
<PRE>
 SQLToTable = SQLToTable F_APPEND(_TABLE_START,&amp;) &amp; &quot;&quot; F_APPEND( _ROW_START,&amp;)</PRE>
<P>OR</P>
<PRE>
 SQLToTable = SQLToTable F_APPEND(_ROW_END,&amp;)</PRE>
