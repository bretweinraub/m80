This is a m80 XML repository; created with m80 --newRepository.

A quick note about the "envs" and "projects" directories.  They aren't strickly needed in
an XML repository, as they are in the tagvalue repository.

Typically the "bdf" template uses m80 include directives to pull in other bits of XML, so
pathing is all relative in that case.
