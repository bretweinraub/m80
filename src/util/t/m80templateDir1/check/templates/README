=head1 DESCRIPTION

This directory is for templated files that need to be
expanded at runtime. There is a tool in shellHelpers that 
can be used to aid in moving these files around:

  print shellHelpers::genAndPushTemplate ( requiredVars => [testhome_unix],
					 templateName => 'createDomain.py.m80',
					 destination => '$testhome_unix');
