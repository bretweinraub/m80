DEPENDENCIES:

1. (BASH) Proper functioning of m80 right now depends on the
installation of bash. This is something that may well change
(depending on the availibility of time and money).  Luckily you can
have BASH installed anywhere, so if /usr/local/bin is verbotten on
this box (and working for a more enlightened organization isn't an
option) consider installing it in your home directory and re-running
configure.
