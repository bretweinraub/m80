I'd rather write programs that write programs, then write programs.
    -Larry Wall

"Lisp programmers can, and often do, write programs to write their programs for them.  
Lisp is the only major language in which this is a routinely used technique, because
Lisp is the only major language to provide the abstractions that make it convenient".
     -Paul Graham, "ANSI Common LISP".
